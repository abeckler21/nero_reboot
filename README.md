# NERO Reboot
### Abby Beckler, Gordon Kindlmann
Non-Equivariance Revealed on Orbits (NERO) Evaluation. The goal of NERO evaluation is to turn focus from traditional scalar-based
metrics onto evaluating and visualizing models equivariance, closely capturing model robustness, as well as to allow researchers
quickly investigating interesting or unexpected model behaviors. NERO evaluation is consist of a task-agnostic interactive interface
and a set of visualizations, called NERO plots, which reveals the equivariance property of the model.
